## Motivation 

Almost all the To-Do apps are complicated, and require the user to enter a lot of information before the app can actually be useful. A lot of them preferred using Notes app to put down their To-Do list.

Keeping this observation in mind, the goal was to design a really simple To-Do application, that gets more work done without letting the user go through the hassle of feeding a lot of data to the app.
